This project was developed with the primary objective of providing a foundational insight into the training of a facial recognition model, enabling the analysis of facial data for the purpose of person identification. This model strives to accurately recognize individuals based on provided data, subsequently automating the process of marking attendance with a high degree of precision. This initiative serves as an illustrative demonstration of the capabilities within the realm of facial recognition technology, underlining its potential implications for efficient attendance management systems.
